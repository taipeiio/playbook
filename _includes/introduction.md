# 美國數位服務遊戲書

美國人希望能透過數位管道，像是網站、電子郵件或行動應用來和政府互動。透過建立更好的數位服務，來滿足使用這些服務的民眾需求，可以更有效的傳達政府政策和計畫。

今日，我們有太多數位服務計畫運作不順利，交付延遲，或超出預算。為了增加計畫成功率，美國政府需要新的作法。因此我們設計了這個包含十三項關鍵**遊戲**的遊戲書，從成功公私兩方實踐的最好方法列出，如果照著進行，將能協助政府建立更有效的數位服務。

The American people expect to interact with government through digital channels such as websites, email, and mobile applications. By building better digital services that meet the needs of the people that use our services, we can make the delivery of our policy and programs more effective.   

Today, too many of our digital services projects do not work well, are delivered late, or are over budget. To increase the success rate of these projects, the U.S. Government needs a new approach. We created a playbook of 13 key “plays” drawn from successful best practices from the private sector and government that, if followed together, will help government build effective digital services.
